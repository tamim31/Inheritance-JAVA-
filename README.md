Java Inheritance Types:

         1.Single Inheritance
         2.Multilevel Inheritance
         3.Hierarchical Inheritance
         4.Multiple Inheritance
         5.Hybrid Inheritance


 Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes. In Java, we can achieve multiple inheritances only through Interfaces.
